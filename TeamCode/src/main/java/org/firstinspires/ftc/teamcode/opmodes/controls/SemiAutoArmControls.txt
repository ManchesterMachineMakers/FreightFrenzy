Two modes: floor, and easel

Arm will move, and wrist will stay level with specified mode

When switch on intake is pressed, arm (and/or drive base) will stop moving for some time, either waiting half a seconds
before allowing movement, locking movement forward, or requiring a button to be pressed before using
again.

TODO:
    Automatically unstow in initialization phase
    Make robot auto-hook (for winching)

DONE:
    Figure out math to keep intake level, either by asking isaac or figuring it out myself
    Implement mode changing
    Implement auto-stop
